## Installing from Github
If you have [cloned the xGraph repository from github](https://github.com/IntrospectiveSystems/xGraph), 
you can install xGraph using npm, system-specific installation files, or compile 
native executables using npm build.  

### Install using npm 
From your command line, navigate to the xGraph repository and run `npm install -g .` will install xgraph 
globally. This will install xgraph from the current
branch of the repository (`sudo` may be required by permissions if on unix systems).

### Install using system-specific installation files
You will find installation files for the major operating systems (Windows, MacOS and Linux) 
in the `./bin/` directory. To install the xGraph CLI using system-specific installation files, 
follow the instructions for your operating system found below.

### For Windows:
You can use the `xgraph.msi` file to install the xgraph CLI. Simply double
click the file and the installer will run.

Additionally, you will have to add the xgraph path variable to your
systems environment variable. This can be done for a single session
through the command line, or you can set the environment variable
permanently through windows settings.

The xgraph path variable is ``` {path to...}ProgramFiles/xGraph```.
Append this to your your Environmental Path Variable ($PATH).

To add the xgraph path variable to your system environment variable, go
to "My Computer" > "Properties" > "Advanced" > "Environment Variables" > "Path"
and add it to the list.

### For Mac:
You can use the `xGraph.dmg` file to install the xgraph CLI. Simply double
click the file and the installer will walk you through the installation
process.

Because the package is unsigned, you may have to allow the installation
of unsigned packages in the security control panel.

### For Linux:
Simply unpack the installation file (.tar or .gz) and restart your terminal
session.

### Compile native executables
In your command line tool, navigate to the root of your xGraph core repository. 
Here, you can enter the following command to build the xGraph executable directly.

```
npm run build
```

If you are on a unix operating system, such as macOS or Ubuntu, you may have to use 
the `sudo` prefix.
```
sudo npm run build
```

## Testing using the npm test
xGraph core is verified using a number of tests. These tests can easily be run using 
the `npm run qc` command for a fast test that tests common xgraph functionality, or the `npm test` command 
for a comprehensive test.  

In your command line tool, navigate to the root of your xGraph core repository. 
Use the following command to run the common tests.
```
npm run qc
```

Or you can enter the either of the following command to run the comprehensive xGraph core tests.
```
npm test
```
or 
```
npm run test
```
